### Abstract:
Prediction of protein secondary structure from the amino acid sequence is a classical bioinformatics problem.
Common methods use feed forward neural networks or SVMâ€™s combined with a sliding window, as these models
does not naturally handle sequential data. Recurrent neural networks are an generalization of the feed forward
neural network that naturally handle sequential data. We use a bidirectional recurrent neural network with long
short term memory cells for prediction of secondary structure and evaluate using the Protein Data Bank dataset.
